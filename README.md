Django-IPFS: Decentralized File Storage with IPFS
This project is a Django-based web application that integrates InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for decentralized file storage. It allows users to upload, retrieve, and manage files securely over a distributed network, leveraging IPFS for efficient, immutable, and censorship-resistant storage.

Features:
File Upload & Retrieval: Store files on IPFS and retrieve them using their unique hash.
Decentralized Storage: Eliminates reliance on centralized servers.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple UI for easy file management.
Django Backend: Secure and scalable framework for handling requests.
IPFS API Integration: Connects seamlessly with an IPFS node.

Usage:
Upload a file via the web interface.
Retrieve stored files using their IPFS hash.
Share files securely without relying on central servers.

Technologies Used:
Django (Python Web Framework)
IPFS (Decentralized File Storage)
SQLite (Database)
Bootstrap (Frontend UI)
